This is a test of the **Emergency Broadcast System**. Do not be alarmed. If
this were not a test, you wouldn't _need_ to know. Hic.

Paragraphs often include [links](https://www.example.com/) and raw URIs of the
form <https://www.example.com/> or something like that.

Some [links](http://www.example.com "Click here!") have titles. And believe it
or not some [other](http://www.example.com){.darkgray} links have attributes!

Confusingly, there are paragraphs that have `<BR>` in them. Called line breaks
in the ancient dialect,  
these need to be treated specially when represented as Markdown. Otherwise the
lines that aren't lines will end up as lines that are part of other lines, and
be wrapped, or unwrapped, accordingly.

Worst of all, however, is that some things \[not what you'd expect\] need to
be _\_really\__ escaped.
