{-
Thin wrapper around **typed-process**'s `readProcess` so that the command
to be executed can be logged. Bit of an annoyance that the command and the
arguments have to be specified to `proc` separately, but that's _execvp(3)_
for you.

TODO this could potentially move to the **unbeliever** library

 If the source file is newer than the target file, then run an action. For
 example, if you want to install a file but only do so if the file has been
 rebuilt, then you could do this:

 @
 copyFileIfNewer :: 'FilePath' -> 'FilePath' -> 'Program' Ï„ ()
 copyFileIfNewer source target = do
     'ifNewer' source target $ do
         'liftIO' ('copyFileWithMetadata' source target)
 @

 This is basically a build system in a box, although the usual caveats
 about the brittleness of timestamps apply.
